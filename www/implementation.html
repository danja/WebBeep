<h1>Long Version : Introduction</h1>

<p>This write-up is rough &amp; ready, mostly I wanted notes for myself,
offboard memory. But however incoherent, hopefully it contains enough
information to explain how this thing works. </p>

<p>There is some digital signal processing jargon, but DSP can just be treated
as black-box stuff, there's really <strong>no need to go into the detailed
maths to build things</strong>. (It's been many years since I last worked on
stuff like this and my maths is totally rusted, the revision I did for this was
mostly skimming Wikipedia - see <a href="#Reference">Reference</a> links). </p>

<h1>Facets of Beep</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Beeps and the Web</strong> : see <a
    href="http://wiki.foaf-project.org/w/DanBri/ChirpChirp">ChirpChirp</a>
    <em>[and <a href="#PS">PS below</a>] </em></li>
  <li><strong>DSP Optimization using a Genetic Algorithm</strong> : the first
    version of the system was sensitive to noise and distortion so I added some
    filters etc. for pre- and post-processing. There were a lot of parameters
    to tweak so I hooked up a genetic algorithm to optimize the thing
    automatically.</li>
  <li><strong>DSP Representation on the Web of Data</strong> : to be able to
    change configuration and parameters easily, a systematic representation was
    needed. I hacked up the current internal representation as I went along,
    but it's crying out to be done in a standard fashion. RDF is the obvious
    choice, so I've started a <a href="http://hyperdata.org/xmlns/dsp/">DSP
    vocabulary/ontology</a>. I know exactly how to proceed with this, see <a
    href="#Future">Future Directions</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a id="Design">Design Considerations</a></h1>

<p>The original idea was to encode HTTP URLs as little tunes, with the
characters in URLs <em>somehow</em> mapping to musical notes. It's essentially
the same idea as used in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_tone">touch-tone</a> phone signals,
but tweaked to make the beeps easier on the ear. </p>

<h2>Text Processing</h2>

<p>International coverage (i.e. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier">IRI</a>s)
is fairly essential, which basically means supporting <strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a></strong>. Because of
this it was decided not to include any optimisations or other special features
for URLs, and simply support <strong>arbitrary text</strong>. Unicode contains
a <em>lot</em> of characters, and mapping from these to musical pitches
directly is almost certainly unfeasible. However <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode">Punycode</a> is an encoding syntax
by which a string of Unicode characters can be transformed uniquely and
reversibly into a much smaller character set. Basically it's <strong>a mapping
to ASCII</strong>. Roughly speaking, characters that can be expressed in ASCII
are expressed that way, but multiple ASCII characters are used to represent
other individual Unicode characters. In general, the cost of reducing the size
of the character set is an increase in the resulting string length. </p>

<h2>Phonic Constraints</h2>

<p>To achieve a reasonable compromise between length of (beep) messages,
musicality and implementation complexity, it was decided that a <strong>maximum
of two concurrent tones</strong> (one bass, one treble) was probably most
suitable. By restricting these to a <strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic">pentatonic scale</a></strong>,
arbitrary combinations of notes could be used without major dissonance. Another
consideration was that generic hardware should be able to transmit and receive
the beeps, so a range of pitches was chosen that should be suitable for common
electroacoustic transducers, i.e. nothing too low or too high (approx.
250-1500Hz, which is around female speech range and a bit higher, or an
extended soprano singer). The restriction to the notes of the pentatonic scale
(i.e. 5 per octave) meant a little more space for data was desirable, so the
treble notes may appear as half- or whole-length.</p>

<p>This may give the impression a lot of planning went into this aspect : not
really, most decisions were made during experimentation, based on what sounded
about right.</p>

<h1><a id="Encoding">Encoding</a></h1>

<p>Generating Web Beeps is relatively straightforward, details of the
requirements can be found in the <a href="spec.html">specification</a>, there's
an example of how this may be implemented in Java in the <a
href="https://github.com/danja/WebBeep">source code</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="encoder block diagram" src="images/encoder-block1.png" width="862"
height="177"></p>

<p><em>sorry messy diagram - will tidy later</em></p>

<p>This is the generalized form of the setup - experimentation showed that
virtually no pre- or post-processing was needed.</p>

<p>The Chars to Chunks block is the most interesting bit. Each chunk,
corresponding to a single ASCII character, has a high frequency and a low
frequency component (high and low bits of the char) of duration 1 or 2 units.
</p>

<p>Lookup tables are used to determine appropriate frequencies for the low tone
and high tone, then the corresponding sine waves are generated and summed.</p>

<h1><a id="Decoding">Decoding</a></h1>

<p>Getting the text back out from the beeps is rather more convoluted (<em>hee
hee</em>), though is based on standard digital signal processing (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">DSP</a>)
techniques. </p>

<p><img alt="decoder block diagram" src="images/decoder-block1.png" width="857"
height="165"></p>

<p>Again, generalized version. Chunks to Chars is the interesting bit here. The
decoder has to find what tone (if any) occurs in each half of the chunk. Some
kind of a pitch detector is needed.</p>

<h2>Pitch Detection</h2>

<p>A crucial step in getting data back from mixed-up tones.</p>

<h2>Pitch Detection</h2>
<del><p>Many pitch detection algorithms are available, here are some examples
ranked in order of guesstimated suitability:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Cross-correlation (against reference waves) : should be the most accurate
    and efficient</li>
  <li>Pisarenko decomposition : can take advantage of prior knowledge (there
    are max 2 tones)</li>
  <li>FFT : brute force, computationally expensive (lots of irrelevant
    cross-correlation) but very well known and easy to see what's going on</li>
  <li>Bandpass filters (one per note) : could maybe be good, as a variation of
    1, need to figure out what to convolve</li>
  <li>Zero-crossing detection/timing : likely to be unreliable</li>
</ol>

<p>Performance shouldn't really be a problem on a PC-like machine or even a
smartphone, though experimentation needed. For accuracy it'd be nice to have
(say) 3 parallel decoding algorithms going, let them vote for the best match.
</p>
</del>

<h1><a id="Initial">Implementation</a></h1>

<p>The reference implementation has been written in Java. </p>

<p>Generating signals is pretty easy, but manipulating them can get hard. So I
assumed I'd need to use a piece of kit like Octave (very like Matlab, only open
source). But as I got into it, it turned out to be straightforward, given the
material available on the Web. </p>

<p>For an internal representation of signals I started with a
<code>List&lt;Double&gt;</code>, expecting to have to turn everything over to
arrays at some point for performance (arrays give me a headache, always
out-by-one). That point didn't arrive, although I've had to translate to/from
arrays here and there for interfacing with libs. <em>Long live
Collections!</em></p>

<h2>Visualization</h2>

<p>I started by playing with generated tones in Audacity, passing them to and
from code as .wav files. Very clunky - it quickly became obvious there was
something I needed above anything else: a simple way of visualizing signals.</p>

<p>Scales and offsets are always a pain, but it didn't take that long to get
something together that was usable: </p>

<p><img alt="test tone plot" src="images/correlation-tone-plot.png" width="800"
height="200"></p>

<p>Plotter.java - a little bit of Swing which takes a List&lt;Double&gt; and
jams it in the window.</p>

<h4>FFT Detection</h4>

<p>The decoder was first developed using FFT for pitch detection - a suitable
FFT class was easily found online (a direct port of a C version). A peak
detector (to identify the peaks in the power spectrum delivered by the FFT) was
also needed. After several unsatisfying experiments I found a public domain
peak detector. The FFT+peak detector setup basically worked but proved very
sensitive to noise and distortion. The code for this is still in the
repository, it's handy having FFT around for spectrum analysis.</p>

<h4>Pre- and Post-Processing</h4>

<p>Because of the robustness problem, I hooked up a series of processing blocks
at various points in the pipeline to help reduce harmonic distorion artifacts
and out-of-band noise. Basically filters plus simple envelope shapers and
normalizers.</p>

<h4>Cross-correlation Blind Alley</h4>

<p>So I tried a second approach, experimenting with cross-correlation. My
intuition said there <em>must</em> be some way of correlating individual
reference tone sine waves with the Beep signals. Rather than run through every
frequency, as in FFT, just pick the ones of interest, the ones known to have
been used in generating the signal. </p>

<h2>Parameters, Parameters, Parameters</h2>

<p>So with the FFT setup I had a bunch of different pipeline modules, each
needing two or three parameters. This was a problem, especially since at least
some of them would interact with each other.</p>

<p>So I got coding again :</p>
<ul>
  <li>refactored the code to allow a systematic way of passing parameters to
    each of the modules</li>
  <li>set up a simulation of a noisy line between encoder and decoder</li>
  <li>decided on a fitness measure based on accuracy, performance etc.</li>
  <li>set up a genetic algorithm to make lots of little simulations and breed
    them</li>
</ul>

<h3>Some Parameters</h3>

<p>This is the current setup. Note that many of the parameters have the value
<strong>.on = false</strong>. It turned out that given a better pitch detection
algorithm, most of these were redundant.</p>

<p><strong>Goertzel to the Rescue</strong></p>

<p>After spending loads of time on the FFT then Danny's Own Correlation
versions, I remembered the close similarity between the encoding here and the
encoding of DTFM signals. How's that usually done? Turns out that there's an
algorithm that in effect does the kind of known-freq correlation thing I was
looking for. It goes by the name of Goertzel. What's more it's remarkable
simple - from Wikipedia:</p>
<pre><code>
s_prev = 0
s_prev2 = 0
normalized_frequency = target_frequency / sample_rate;
coeff = 2*cos(2*PI*normalized_frequency);
for each sample, x[n],
  s = x[n] + coeff*s_prev - s_prev2;
  s_prev2 = s_prev;
  s_prev = s;
end
power = s_prev2*s_prev2 + s_prev*s_prev - coeff*s_prev*s_prev2;</code></pre>

<h3>Applications for Web Beep</h3>

<p>Dunno really, but see <a
href="http://wiki.foaf-project.org/w/DanBri/ChirpChirp">ChirpChirp</a> <em>[and
<a href="#PS">PS below</a>]</em></p>

<p>As a kind of QR Code for the ear, Web Beeps should be useful in a lot of
places. <em>Suggestions please...</em></p>

<p>Ring Tone - use your email, Home Page or personal URI. </p>

<h3>Application for the DSP bits</h3>

<p>Take it from me, pluggable, modular, parameterized,
declaratively-configurable DSP systems should have plenty of applications.
Making such things Web-friendly would almost certainly be very advantageous. So
I've started a <a href="http://hyperdata.org/xmlns/dsp/">DSP
vocab/ontology</a>.</p>

<p>The Java representation contains the important structural information needed
for described DSP systems, so my plan is to add a variant on the
<code>toString()</code> method in the classes of the code
(<code>describe()</code>) to deliver RDF/Turtle and use a bit of reflection to
get the code to describe itself.</p>

<p>To enhance this a bit there's David Huyn's RDFizer Javadoc thingy, which I
plan to tweak to use HTTP URLs (rather than its current URNs).</p>

<p>Now if someone will please suggest applications for Web-friendly pluggable,
modular, parameterized, declaratively-configurable DSP systems...</p>

<h2>Patent Pending?</h2>

<p><strong>No. </strong><strong><a
href="http://en.swpat.org/wiki/Blocking_innovation_and_research">Software
patents hurt innovation</a>.</strong></p>

<p>In any case, I'm sure many variations of this have been done before, though
it's hard to find out what there is. Searches I've tried mostly led to
something related to mobile/cellphone ringtones (I wanted the name "Web Tone"
but it's already taken).</p>

<p>The basic idea is fairly trivial: what if you had something like DTFM tones
only not so hard on the ear? Given that, implementations are pretty obvious
given minimal background knowledge of character encoding, music and DSP. Simple
matter of guesswork, experimentation &amp; banging out the code. The
implementation described here is pretty arbitrary, mostly based on what seemed
like a good idea at the time.</p>

<p><a name="PS" id="PS">PS</a>. I already held <a

talking about something vaguely similar recently. What I'd completely forgotten
was that he'd suggested exactly this idea - and even done a write-up: <a
