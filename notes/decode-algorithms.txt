NEED A CHECKSUM?
(& acknowledge receipt?)

pre-process with bp filters (one high, one low?)

pitch detection algorithm options:
0. FFT : brute force, but easy to see what's going on
1. zero-crossing : probably way too unreliable
2. cross-correlate with reference waves : should be by far the best
3. BP filter per note : probably ok, but inefficient compared to 2.
4. Pisarenko decomposition : probably somewhere between 0 and 2.
