# Barcodes for the Ears

[Live Web Beeps](https://hyperdata.it/webbeep/)

I've just gone back to this after about 10 years...

It's written in Java, there's an ant build file, but all the classes are already compiled here.

## Installation

Clone all this.

You'll need Java & lame

sudo apt install lame

sudo apt install default-jdk

Edit server/port in start.sh

Run that to start the server.

webbeep.service to run as a systemd service
